				<h1>Characters in A Court of Thorns and Roses</h1>
				<p> In the A Court of Thorns and Roses series, Feyre, Rhys, and Tamlin are the main characters and offer the best evidence of characterization.</p>
				<h2> Feyre Archeron </h2>
				<p>   The most obvious example of Sarah J. Maas' exceptional characterization is in the form of the main character, Feyre Archeron.  Today's young adult genre has seen an influx of modern heroines like that of The Hunger Games' Katniss Everdeen and Divergent's
					Beatrice Prior.  Both characters fit the troupe of selfless, brave, and rebellious young women.  However, it seems that in the cases for both characters, their decisions are predictable because their
					characters remain stagnant.  In the case of Feyre, there's impeccable evidence of character development.  The most obvious development of Feyre is seen in the second novel, with the most noticable example
					occuring when she and Rhys visit a prison to visit the Bone Carver to learn the answer to questions about the couldron that can shatter the wall separating the human and faerie realms and the book that
					contains the spells to do it.</p>
					<p>In exchange for their answers, the Bone Carver asks for Feyre and Rhys to tell him something no one knows and also answer the questions he asks them.  Feyre explains the third
					task she had to complete for Amarantha- to earn Tamlin's freedom but also the freedom of all the fae in Prythian, earning Fayre the name "Curse Breaker." Feyre was forced to stab three innocent faeries with a ash knife,
					the only substance that can kill a faerie. After killing the first two innocent fae, the third faerie ends up being Tamlin. Fayre is able to conclude stabbing Tamlin won't kill him and so she does and is proven right and
					breaks the curse. Feyre reveals to the Bone Carver that had the third faerie not been Tamlin, she would've stabbed and killed the third faerie then turned the knife on herself and kill herself.  This revelation speaks of
					the character of Feyre and of her desperation to save the man she loves but inability to live with the guilt. It reveals a characteristic that not many modern heroines seem to have which is doubt in their decisions.</p>
