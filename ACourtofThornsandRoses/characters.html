				<h1>Characters in A Court of Thorns and Roses</h1>
				<p> In the A Court of Thorns and Roses series, Feyre, Rhys, and Tamlin are the main characters and offer the best evidence of characterization.</p>
				<h2> Feyre Archeron </h2>
				<p>   The most obvious example of Sarah J. Maas' exceptional characterization is in the form of the main character, Feyre Archeron.  Today's young adult genre has seen an influx of modern heroines like that of The Hunger Games' Katniss Everdeen and Divergent's
					Beatrice Prior.  Both characters fit the troupe of selfless, brave, and rebellious young women.  However, it seems that in the cases for both characters, their decisions are predictable because their
					characters remain stagnant.  In the case of Feyre, there's impeccable evidence of character development.  The most obvious development of Feyre is seen in the second novel, with the most noticable example
					occuring when she and Rhys visit a prison to visit the Bone Carver to learn the answer to questions about the couldron that can shatter the wall separating the human and faerie realms and the book that
					contains the spells to do it.</p>
					<p>In exchange for their answers, the Bone Carver asks for Feyre and Rhys to tell him something no one knows and also answer the questions he asks them.  Feyre explains the third
					task she had to complete for Amarantha- to earn Tamlin's freedom but also the freedom of all the fae in Prythian, earning Fayre the name "Curse Breaker." Feyre discusses how she had three faeries lined up
					before her, bags over their heads.  She was given a knife made of ash, the only thing that can kill fae, and was told to kill the three innocent faeries.  The first faerie, a man, begged for her not to do it,
					but she did it anyway.  The second faerie, a female, was praying to the cauldron but nodded to Fayre, which Feyre perceived as the innocent fae realizing she had to die for the rest of the faeries to be freed,
					and Feyre stabbed her. The final faerie was Tamlin.  It took Feyre a while, but she was able to work out the clues he and others left to her, that his heart was made of stone and therefore, would not be killed.
					When Fayre stabbed him, she successfully completed the third task.  After describing what happened Under the Mountain to the Bone Carver, Feyre revealed that if the last faerie hadn't been Tamlin, she would've
					stabbed and killed the innocent faerie, then turn the knife on herself and kill herself.  This revelation speaks of the character Feyre was, desperate to free the man she loved and his people, but unable to live
					with murdering three innocent faeries.</p>
