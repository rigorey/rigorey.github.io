				<h1>Characters in A Court of Thorns and Roses</h1>
				<p> Below is a video of the characters in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series.  It includes who I believe could portray them in a movie, along with helpful pronounciations of names and descriptions of their characters' roles.</p>
				<p> INSERT VIDEO HERE </p>
				<h2> Characters of Particular Significance</h1>
				<p> In my opinion, Feyre and Rhys are the two characters that provide the most substance to the series along with providing the most obvious examples of Sarah J. Maas' knack for characterization. </p>
				<h3>Feyre Archeron <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/05/79/80/0579801f9393860253b8d53ebaa9e86d.png" alt="bow and arrow" class="larger-image1" align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
				<p>   The most obvious example of Sarah J. Maas' exceptional characterization is in the form of the main character, Feyre Archeron.  Today's young adult genre has seen an influx of modern heroines like that of The Hunger Games' Katniss Everdeen and Divergent's
					Beatrice Prior.  Both characters fit the troupe of selfless, brave, and rebellious young women.  However, it seems that in the cases for both characters, their decisions are predictable because their
					characters remain stagnant.  In the case of Feyre, there's impeccable evidence of character development.  The most obvious development of Feyre is seen in the second novel, with the most noticable example
					occuring when she and Rhys visit a prison to visit the Bone Carver to learn the answer to questions about the couldron that can shatter the wall separating the human and faerie realms and the book that
					contains the spells to do it.</p>
					<p>In exchange for their answers, the Bone Carver asks for Feyre and Rhys to tell him something no one knows and also answer the questions he asks them.  Feyre explains the third
					task she had to complete for Amarantha- to earn Tamlin's freedom but also the freedom of all the fae in Prythian, earning Fayre the name "Curse Breaker." Feyre was forced to stab three innocent faeries with a ash knife,
					the only substance that can kill a faerie. After killing the first two innocent fae, the third faerie ends up being Tamlin. Fayre is able to conclude stabbing Tamlin won't kill him and so she does and is proven right and
					breaks the curse. Feyre reveals to the Bone Carver that had the third faerie not been Tamlin, she would've stabbed and killed the third faerie then turned the knife on herself and kill herself.  This revelation speaks of
					the character of Feyre and of her desperation to save the man she loves but inability to live with the guilt. It reveals a characteristic that not many modern heroines seem to have which is doubt in their decisions.</p>
<h3> Rhysand, High Lord of the Night Court&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://www.goodfreephotos.com/albums/other-landscapes/stars-above-the-mountains.jpg" alt="mountains with bright stars" class="larger-image2"></h2>
 <p> The character of Rhysand is a rather interesting one.  When we're first introduced to the High Lord, we see an arrogant faerie who acts like he's the most powerful faerie to exist.  What further contributes to the character
	 of Rhys is the representation of him through his court.  The Night Court is split into the Court of Nightmares and the Court of Dreams, both of which can represent Rhys' character.  The Court of Nightmares is the side of Rhys that
	 is introduced Under the Mountain that is a cocky guy who threatens everybody with his ability to control their minds and kill them with a single thought.  On the other hand, the Court of Dreams speaks of the side of Rhys that is a
	 dreamer. It's the Rhys that believed Feyre would defeat Amarantha Under the Mountain, it's the Rhys that became Amarantha's lackey so he could protect his hidden Court of Dreams and it's the Rhys that Feyre falls in love with.
	 As the story continues and we see more of Rhys, the most obvious word for him is "misunderstood." When it becomes apparent that Rhys is actually the most powerful faerie in Prythian, his softer side becomes even more evident.</p>
