				<h1>An Interview With a High Fae</h1>
				<p>The people of Prythian are pretty obsessed with the life of Feyre "Curse Breaker" Archeron- the human turned faerie who saved their lives from Amarantha.
					While Under the Mountain, everyone knew Feyre's every move: from whose room she had to clean to the deal she made with Rhys. All the fae were also quite obsessed
					with the relationship between Fayre and Tamlin- what he saw in a human and what the faerie-hating human saw in him.  When Amarantha was beat and Fayre returned to the
					Spring Court, Tamlin kept her on a tight leash, preventing the public from seeing Feyre and keeping up the gossip.</p>
					<p> However, it caused quite the scene when Rhys calledin the bargin the first time, even more so when he called in the bargin on Feyre and Tamlin's wedding day.
						Despite the hot gossip, the Night Court is pretty frightening	and rarely do outsiders visit, so once Feyre moves there, all outside gossip- including all that
						about her- becomes lost. Additionally, Rhys is a very private person.  Even the members of his inner circle are unknown to outsiders.  All gossip surrounding Rhys'
						relationship to Feyre is just that-gossip.  No proof is offered that Feyre and Rhys are in a relationship, they even perform their mating ritual in secret.</p>
						<p> The clip below provides insight into what an interview with Feyre would be like with a gossip magazine in Prythian.</p>
