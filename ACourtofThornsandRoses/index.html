				<h1>A Court of Thorns and Roses</h1>
				<p>	The first novel in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series introduces the main character, human Fayre Archeron.  Left as the sole provider for her two spoiled, older sisters and invalid father, she goes into the woods to hunt where she attacks a wolf- who turns out to be a faerie in disguise.
					The death of the faerie brings Tamlin, High Lord of the Spring Court, to the Archeron home, demanding the life of the killer in place of his man.  Fayre, willing to go into faerie territory to protect her family, travels with Tamlin to his land, where she remains hidden in the room he provides for her.
					Her ability to survive in tough circumstance impresses Tamlin while Fayre begins to realize not all faeries are as terrible is she was taught to believe.  Eventually, Fayre learns of a "plight" attacking Tamlin's court, a surge in the "plight" having caused masks to be fused to Tamlin's face along with the fae in his court.</p>
					<p>	While Fayre is growing closer to Tamlin, the "plight" is getting stronger, which scares Tamlin into sending Feyre back to the human realm, telling her it's because she loves him. Upon returning to the human world, Feyre discovers she loves Tamlin too, and wishes to return to him.  When Feyre returns to the Spring Court, she learns
					that the "plight" is in fact a faerie named Amarantha who managed to trap all of the High Lord's magic inside herself, even to a lesser extent, Tamlin's.  In addition, Amarantha gave Tamlin 49 years to get a human woman who once hated faeries to fall in love with one.  Since Feyre was his best chance, and he sent her home, he was
					unable to fulfill Amarantha's deal, which means he has to spend the rest of his life "Under the Mountain", Amarantha's domain.</p>
				 <P> Feyre travels Under the Mountain to try and convince Amarantha that she did hate faeries, but now loves Tamlin. Amarantha tells her she would believe her, if she can complete three tasks or solve the answer
				  to a riddle.  Unable to answer the riddle, Feyre agrees to the tasks. After successfully completing the first task in which she's injured, Feyre makes a deal with Rhysand, High Lord of the Night Court. In exchange for him healing her, she owes him a week every month if she survives, which he believes she will. When Feyre beats the other
					two tasks and solves the riddle, Amarantha gets angry and snaps Feyre's neck.  The deal Feyre made with Rhysand suspends her between death and life and the seven high lords agree to make her faerie in exchange for her releasing them from Amarantha.  A brand new faerie, Feyre returns with Tamlin to the Spring Court. </p>

				<h1>A Court of Mist and Fury</h1>
				<p>	The second novel in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series begins with Feyre preparing for her wedding to Tamlin, while also coming to terms with her being a faerie and coping with the new powers she's accumulated from the High Lords making her.  Feyre is struggling with nightmares from being trapped Under the Mountain, being made even
					worse by Tamlin keeping her trapped in the Spring Court. Feyre's first reprieve comes in the form of Rhysand, when he calls in their bargin three months after they were all Under the Mountain. Feyre is angry with Rhysand for taking her away, but also relieved because she needed a break from Tamlin's confining ways.  When Feyre returns for
					her wedding, Tamlin becomes more obsessed with keeping her "safe." So much so that when Feyre walks down the aisle, she sends signals down her bond to Rhysand that she doesn't want to marry Tamlin, and Rhysand shows up, using their deal as an excuse to take her away. </p>
