				<h1>A Court of Thorns and Roses</h1>
				<p>	The first novel in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series introduces the main character, human Fayre Archeron.  Left as the sole provider for her two spoiled, older sisters and invalid father, she goes into the woods to hunt where she attacks a wolf- who turns out to be a faerie in disguise.
					The death of the faerie brings Tamlin, High Lord of the Spring Court, to the Archeron home, demanding the life of the killer in place of his man.  Fayre, willing to go into faerie territory to protect her family, travels with Tamlin to his land, where she remains hidden in the room he provides for her.
					Her ability to survive in tough circumstance impresses Tamlin while Fayre begins to realize not all faeries are as terrible is she was taught to believe.  Eventually, Fayre learns of a "plight" attacking Tamlin's court, a surge in the "plight" having caused masks to be fused to Tamlin's face along with the fae in his court.</p>
					<p>	While Fayre is growing closer to Tamlin, the "plight" is getting stronger, which scares Tamlin into sending Feyre back to the human realm, telling her it's because she loves him. Upon returning to the human world, Feyre discovers she loves Tamlin too, and wishes to return to him.  When Feyre returns to the Spring Court, she learns
					that the "plight" is in fact a faerie named Amarantha who managed to trap all of the High Lord's magic inside herself, even to a lesser extent, Tamlin's.  In addition, Amarantha gave Tamlin 49 years to get a human woman who once hated faeries to fall in love with one.  Since Feyre was his best chance, and he sent her home, he was
					unable to fulfill Amarantha's deal, which means he has to spend the rest of his life "Under the Mountain", Amarantha's domain.</p>

				 <P> Feyre travels Under the Mountain to try and convince Amarantha that she did hate faeries, but now loves Tamlin. Amarantha tells her she would believe her, if she can complete three tasks or solve the answer
				  to a riddle.  Unable to answer the riddle, Feyre agrees to the tasks. After successfully completing the first task in which she's injured, Feyre makes a deal with Rhysand, High Lord of the Night Court. In exchange for him healing her, she owes him a week every month if she survives, which he believes she will. When Feyre beats the other
					two tasks and solves the riddle, Amarantha gets angry and snaps Feyre's neck.  The deal Feyre made with Rhysand suspends her between death and life and the seven high lords agree to make her faerie in exchange for her releasing them from Amarantha.  A brand new faerie, Feyre returns with Tamlin to the Spring Court. </p>

				<h1>A Court of Mist and Fury</h1>
				<p>	The second novel in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series begins with Feyre preparing for her wedding to Tamlin, while also coming to terms with her being a faerie and coping with the new powers she's accumulated from the High Lords making her.  Feyre is struggling with nightmares from being trapped Under the Mountain, being made even
					worse by Tamlin keeping her trapped in the Spring Court. Feyre's first reprieve comes in the form of Rhysand, when he calls in their bargin three months after they were all Under the Mountain. Feyre is angry with Rhysand for taking her away, but also relieved because she needed a break from Tamlin's confining ways.  When Feyre returns for
					her wedding, Tamlin becomes more obsessed with keeping her "safe." So much so that when Feyre walks down the aisle, she sends signals down her bond to Rhysand that she doesn't want to marry Tamlin, and Rhysand shows up, using their deal as an excuse to take her away. Back at the Night Court, Rhysand explains to Feyre the threat of Hybern-
				another Faerie land where humans either die or live as slaves to faeries. The King Of Hybern is threatening the peace between Prythian and the human realm next to it.  Rhysand, alive during the war 500 years ago that freed humans from faerie masters, doesn't want to see it happen again. He hopes to use Feyre's new found powers as a means to
				defeat the King of Hybern. </p>

				<p> Rhysand, hoping to convince Feyre to help him, shows her the other side of the Night Court, the Court of Dreams.  It, along with Rhys' role as a dreamer, convinces Feyre to join him and save the human realm. Rhys, a half Illyrian- a warrior breed of faeries- trains Feyre to hone her powers, which she is able to use to locate and steal
					half of an ancient book that can disable the "cauldron" the King of Hybern intends to use to shatter the wall that separates the humans and faeries.  Along the way, Rhys and Feyre are attacked by some of the King of Hybern's forces, which nearly kills Rhys. While trying to save him, Feyre learns that she and Rhys are mates- a faerie rite
					that binds two faeries together in a bond stronger than love and marriage. At first Feyre's angry because Rhys knew and didn't tell her, but eventually she can't she feels the connection too.  As the pair, along with the other members of Rhys' inner circle, prepare to travel to Hybern and steal the cauldron, Rhys and Feyre secretly finalize their
					mating ritual and Feyre becomes High Lady of the Night Court, something no other court has had before.</p>
					<p> The group leaves for Hybern where they are able to infilatrate the King of Hybern's castle and quickly locate the cauldron. They're met with the King of Hybern's second-in-command, Jurion, who distracts them long enough for the King of Hybern to put a spell on them that prevents their powers from working.  When the King of Hybern arrives, he
						has Tamlin with him.  Tamlin has agreed to allow the King of Hybern to use his lands to access the Wall and Human lands if he got Feyre back, which the King was indeed able to do.  When Feyre discovers this, she realizes the only way to save Rhys, his friends, and her newly turned faerie sisters is to pretend she was being held captive by Rhys.
						Feyre acts as though Rhys is a monster who has held her captive, runs to Tamlin, and begs him to take her away from Rhys and for the King of Hybern to break their bond made by the deal.  The King does as he is asked, not realizing they're bonded by the mating spell as well and the spell that made Feyre High Lady of the Night Court.  The distraction
						the bond breaking gives them time to get out and for Feyre to tell Tamlin how sorry she is and how much she loves him.  Tamlin returns to the Spring Court with Feyre in tow, not realizing he's bringing the High Lady of the Night Court into his lands with a direct line of communication to the High Lord of the Night Court.
