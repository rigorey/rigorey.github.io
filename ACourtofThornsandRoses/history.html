				<h1>A Court of Thorns and Roses: A History</h1>
				<p>A pivotal part of the A Court of Thorns and Roses series is the history between the human realm and the world of the fae.
				500 years before the stories take place, a war occured between the faeries. Half the fae fought for the emancipation of their
			human slaves while the other half fought to keep them. Some of the fae introduced in the series, including Rhysand and Tamlin, fought
		in the war. Rhys, having just recently become High Lord of the Night Court, fought to free the human slaves.  Tamlin, under his father as
		High Lord, fought to keep them.</p>
		<p> Furthermore, Amarantha, a general under the King of Hybern, fought to keep the human slaves.  However, all the while she wsa fighting to keep the
			lesser humans as slaves, her sister was falling in love with Jurion, a human general.  He was only using Amarantha's sister as a way to gain intel
			and was in love with another human woman.  When he was done with Amarantha's sister, he killed her and intended to run away with his human lover.
			Amarantha, angry with her sister for trusting a human and even angrier with the human, battled with Jurion and ripped him to pieces- all that remained was
			a finger bone and eye ball. She kept the eye ball on a ring and the bone on a necklace until she was killed 500 years later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

			 </p>
			<p> After the war, a treaty was made to protect the relations between the humans and the fae, thus building the wall the King of Hybern plans on destroying.
				The cauldron that created the wall was hidden and the spell book that controls it was split in two- half going to the mortal world, the other half remaining
				with the fae.</p>
