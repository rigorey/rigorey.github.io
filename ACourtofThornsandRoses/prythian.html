				<h1>The Faerie Realm Beyond the Wall: Prythian</h1>
				<p>Prythian, the faerie world in the <i>A Court of Thorns and Roses</i> series, is divided from the human realm by a magical wall.
					It's split into seven courts, each with a powerful High Lord overseeing it. Each High Lord has magical powers, their strongest
					being derived from the lands they control.  Additionally, each court has particular holidays they celebrate, particular customs
					they follow, and particular fashions they wear.</p>

<h2>For most fae, it's easy to determine which court they belong to, but that isn't the case for all species.</h1>
<h2> Fae Species that don't belong to a specific court:</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Bogge (Boh-ghi)- Species of fae that takes the shape of mist. It's harmless unless another faerie looks directly at it.</li>
	<li> Suriel (Sur-ee-el)- Species of fae adorned in tattered robes and has a skeletal appearance. Suriel are hard to capture but if they are caught, they can answer any questions they may be asked.</li>
	<li> Puca (Pu-kah)- Species of fae that can manilpulate its appearance to look like whatever it wants.  They're able to determine what their enemy wants most to lure it away and attack.</li>
	<li> Naga (Nah-gah)- Species of fae that appear as a mixture of snake and human.  They travel in packs to attack their prey.</li>
</ul>
